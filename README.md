üöÄ Real Estate Price Prediction Project Overview

üìà Objective:
The Real Estate Price Prediction project is geared towards forecasting property prices using the XGBoost regression algorithm. Leveraging various features like square footage, location, and amenities, the project aims to create a robust predictive model for real estate prices.

üóÇÔ∏è Key Steps in the Project:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading:

Import and load the real estate dataset, including essential property features and pricing information.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing:

Eliminate irrelevant columns and handle missing values.
Utilize one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning models.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Selection:

Identify key features contributing significantly to the prediction of property prices.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Imputation:

Address missing values in the dataset using the SimpleImputer strategy, ensuring completeness for training.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training (XGBoost):

Implement the XGBoost regression algorithm to train the model on the preprocessed data.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation - Training Set:

Assess the model's performance on the training set, utilizing metrics like R-squared and mean absolute error.
Visualize the correlation between actual and predicted prices with a scatter plot.
7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation - Testing Set:

Extend the evaluation to the testing set, ensuring the model's generalization ability.
Calculate R-squared and mean absolute error for comprehensive performance assessment.
8Ô∏è‚É£ Predictions:

Apply the trained XGBoost model to make predictions on new data, facilitating the identification of real estate prices.
